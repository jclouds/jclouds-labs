jclouds Labs OpenStack
======================

Repository for developing OpenStack providers and APIs

Although this is a "labs" repository, some of the providers and APIs here are production ready. The reason they have not been merged into into jclouds core is because there isn't a suitable abstraction layer for them yet. Please review the README in each sub-directory to determine if the provider or API is production ready.
